This project analyzes housing data from Cook County to explore key trends in residential real estate prices and develop predictive models for housing prices. 
The goal is to understand the factors that influence the value of homes in Cook County and assess the predictive performance of linear regression models on real-world data.

In Part 1, we perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the structure and limitations of the dataset, helping us make key modeling decisions. 
This includes cleaning the data, addressing missing values and outliers, and engineering new features to prepare the data for modeling.

In Part 2, we specify and fit multiple linear regression models using selected dataset features to predict house sale prices. 
We analyze model errors, evaluate performance, and iteratively refine the model to improve prediction accuracy. 
Finally, we examine the broader implications of predictive modeling in the context of the Cook County Assessor’s Office (CCAO) case study,
considering how modeling choices can impact real-world assessments and stakeholders.
